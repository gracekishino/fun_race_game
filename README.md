# Fun Race Game

Iâ€™m taking Codecademy's Computer Science Career Path and part of the course is writing a simple in Python game. 

I wanted to create a collaborative game so created a race where the aim is for two players to BOTH finish in as few gos as possible.

I really enjoyed coding, testing and then playing the game once it was finished. 

Below are a few screenshots of a game in action.
