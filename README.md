# Fun Race Game

I’m learning computer science with Codecademy and part of the course is writing a simple game in Python. 
I wanted to create a collaborative game so created a race when the aim was for two players to BOTH finish in as few gos as possible.

I really enjoyed coding, testing and playing the game once it was finished. Below are a few screenshots and if you’d like to play it, here is the code on GitHub. 
Any feedback is extremely welcome! 🙏
