# Fun Race Game

I’m learning computer science with Codecademy and part of the course is writing a simple game in Python. 
I wanted to create a collaborative game so created a race where the aim is for two players to BOTH finish in as few gos as possible.

I really enjoyed coding, testing and playing the game once it was finished. 

Below are a few screenshots, download the code if you’d like to play it! 🥰

Any feedback is extremely welcome! 🙏
